# mail_chimp_subscription_format

This is a short script used to format any mailing lists we get for the collective for use in uploading into mail chimp. This will be used when we run a giveaway and the email collection is done by an affiliate partner. This will be updated over time. See the attached power point __ReadMe__ of how to use the script.

# google_sheets_scheduling_app

This is a google app script I made for The Coyote Collective in order to more efficiently create scheduled events and important dates in a shared calendar. This is a work in progress and will slowly be updated as the company needs different functionality. Also given that I dont want to add any of our more senistive spreadsheets into git hub, if anyone wants me to send them a skeleton spreadsheet to go with the Javascript code I would be happy to email them directly. Just shoot me an email and ask! 

Note: we didnt want to pay for an instagram scheduler service so this app was made to help our instagram posts get more consitant. 

# visualize_financial_data 

This script wil be used to produce a financial report that can be sent out in a monthly email to all of the other executives of The Coyote Collective. This should visualize; specific projects (expenses, cash in, profit, loss), balance sheet summary. 

# client_receipt

This script will create a receipt to send clients when we receive payment. Our graphic designer will make a simple layout in adobe, export it to a html file, and this script will have a GUI that takes in the: invoice number, amount, date, company name, etc.
